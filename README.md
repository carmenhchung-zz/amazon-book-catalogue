# BASIC AMAZON CHALLENGE - Version 1 (25 August 2017)

## Task

We were asked to code a basic version of Amazon (i.e. the ability to purchase books and have the program recommend other books to the customer, based on their previous choice(s)).

## Synopsis

The program asks the user whether they would like to (i) browse the catalogue of books, (ii) see book recommendations, or (iii) exit the program.

Browsing the catalogue will allow you to see a list of all the books in the catalogue, from which you can select book(s) to purchase. Requesting book recommendations means that the customer will be given a list of books in a particular category - if they have selected books before, the program will calculate which category the customer has chosen the most number of books from, and will offer recommendations of all the books from that category. If they have not chosen book(s) before, then the default suggestion will be the fiction category.

Once the customer has selected their book(s), they can check out, which will provide them with the total price of the books they have selected.
